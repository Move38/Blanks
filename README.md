# Blanks
A sketch to be placed on all shipping Blanks.

These Blinks should not look like they are part of a game. When not being interacted with, they should look... for lack of a better word, _blank_. When being interacted with, they should inform the user that they do infact respond. Button presses will signal acknowledgement and attachments will as well. The only color used for Blanks will be WHITE, which is admittedly purplish, so it will remain a neutral and non-game color.

### Teachable moments:
1. Blinks have a button - press the top and the light goes dim
2. Blinks react to neighboring Blinks - attach to a neighbor and see the side brighten temporarily
3. Blinks, when alone, can enter program mode (Blink Sync) - press and hold the top, an accelerating rotation builds and after 3 seconds the Blink enters program mode.
4. Blinks can be forced to sleep - press an hold the top, an accelerating rotation builds and after 6 seconds the Blink flashes a _goodnight_ blue and goes dark, sending all neighboring Blinks to sleep as well.
5. Blinks wake each other from a warm sleep. Put Blinks to sleep and then press a single Blink to see all connected Blinks awake with a rise and shine animation.
